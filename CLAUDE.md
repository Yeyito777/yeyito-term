You're in my st fork's source.
This fork coordinates with zsh through .zshrc to be able to do a lot of its operations.
You can check the zsh config required for many of the features in this terminal to work in: README.md.
Make sure to modify the required zsh config in README.md if you make a change that needs a change in it.
